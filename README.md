# Crawler-WebScraper
Hi this is a web scraper and app.py is the simple version of the project to understand the concept.
You will first have to install Ollama to your desktop as it runs locally and then by using "pull ollama llama3" you can download the respective model locally. 

After this install all the imports present at the top of the code and you will be good to go!
Copy and paste any URl and ask the model questions regarding it. Please keep in mind if it takes too long to load either your device is slow or the website is too large to scrape.

Use app2.py after you have understood the concept , its just a better UI version of the original one
Thankyou.
